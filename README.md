## System Architecture

| Layer        | Technology                          |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| Frontend     | ASP.NET Razor Views, Bootstrap 5     |
| Backend      | ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework Core   |
| Database     | Microsoft SQL Server                 |
| Audit Log    | `ActivityLog` for all key operations |

- Separation of concerns via MVC architecture (Models, Views, Controllers)
- Entity Framework Code First with normalized relational database schema
- Git-based collaboration using feature branches (e.g., `vincent`, `gerry`) merged into `forge` for integration and testing

## Figma-Aligned UI Modules

### 1. **Dashboard**

- Real-time statistics: today’s enrollments, weekly totals
- Most enrolled courses (e.g., *Computer Science – 1250*, *Nursing – 150*)
- Total faculty count
- Activity feed with audit trail showing:
  - New enrollments
  - Course completions
  - Student registrations

> **Implemented by**: *Mercy Migendi* and *Brian Vuhuga*

---

### 2. **Register**

- **Add Student Form**:
  - Captures: Full name, email, gender, date of birth, national ID, county, phone number, admission number, and campus
  - Relational dropdowns for: gender, department, program, level, and campus
- **Student List**:
  - Paginated, searchable list showing department, progress, academic year
- **Enrollments**:
  - Enroll student into one or more courses
  - Bulk enrollment supported:
    - Multiple students to one course
    - All students to all courses
    - Filtered by program or academic year

> **Implemented by**: *Gerry Migiro*, *Elvis Karinge*  
> **Extended by**: *Elvis Karinge* – for enhanced student detail capture

---

### 3. **Courses & Academic Configuration (Dropdown Navigation)**

The "Courses" navigation now includes a **dropdown menu** that leads to modular sub-pages for configuring all academic metadata. This makes the platform scalable and eliminates hardcoded values.

#### Submodules:

- **Course List**
  - Accordion UI grouped by department
  - Each course shows: name, level, exam body, study status
- **Add Course Form**
  - Relational dropdowns for: department, program, exam body, level, campus, study mode, and study status
- **Departments**
- **Programs**
- **Exam Bodies**
- **Campuses**
- **Study Modes**
- **Study Levels**

Each submodule allows administrators to manage institutional data dynamically from the UI, reflecting updates immediately throughout the system.

> **Implemented by**: *Vincent Omondi Owuor* and *Gerry Migiro*

### 4. **Reports**

- Dynamic filters:
  - Department
  - Course
  - Faculty
  - Year
  - Enrollment Status
- Report Output Includes:
  - Student ID
  - Course
  - Department
  - Exam score
  - Grade
  - Transcript status
- Export functionality (CSV, PDF) currently in development

## Database Schema Overview

EduCore uses a **normalized SQL Server** schema with referential integrity, foreign key constraints, and support for auditability. The system is extensible, ensuring new data types or structures can be added without affecting core functionality.

### Main Entities

- `Students`: Stores biodata, contact information, department, gender, program, and campus
- `Courses`: Defines academic offerings and links to departments, programs, levels, study modes, campuses, and exam bodies
- `Enrollments`: Many-to-many relationship between students and courses, tracking enrollment status
- `ActivityLog`: Captures entity operations (e.g., "Student Registered", "Course Enrolled") with user reference and timestamp

### Lookup Tables

- `Departments`
- `Programs`
- `ExamBodies`
- `Campuses`
- `StudyModes`
- `StudyLevels`
- `Genders`
- `Counties`
- `StudyStatuses`

### Entity Relationship Highlights

- **Students ↔ Enrollments ↔ Courses** (many-to-many)
- **Courses** reference multiple normalized lookup entities
- **Enrollments** use composite primary key (`StudentID`, `CourseID`) to enforce uniqueness
- **Audit Logs** are linked to user actions for traceability
